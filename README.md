## About <a name="about"></a>

Excel-based financial model for calculating unlevered free cash flow via various revenue and expense driver assumptions. The model projects revenue and expenses in full detail and uses a balance sheet / cash flow statement proxy for core working capital items and capital expenditures.

Key elements within revenue and expense drivers are linked to scenario-based values (base, upside, downside) that can be toggled dynamically within the General Assumptions section at the top of the model. 

The model assumes (i) subscription, (ii) license, and (iii) maintenance revenue items with respective customer growth and retention rates. Revenue per full-time R&D employee is assumed to drive R&D headcount and associated operating expenses.

## Use Cases <a name="use_cases"></a>

1. Unlevered free cash flow projections for founders and strategy teams at software start-ups
2. Starting template for valuation analysis 
3. Starting template for a comprehensive operating model
